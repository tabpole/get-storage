It is designed to be efficient and fast, even for large amounts of data. The package is particularly useful for storing small to medium-sized data, such as user settings, cached data, and other configuration information in a Flutter or Dart application.</p><p>The package supports both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for accessing and manipulating stored data. It also provides encryption capabilities to store data securely in an encrypted form using the AES algorithm. The package uses the Flutter framework&#39;s Path Provider to determine the directory in which to store data.</p><p>Some of the key features of &quot;Get Storage&quot; include a simple and intuitive API for storing and retrieving data, support for storing different data types, such as strings, integers, booleans, lists, and maps, efficient performance, and cross-platform compatibility with Flutter and Dart applications.</p><p>Overall, &quot;Get Storage&quot; is a useful and versatile package that can help developers to efficiently manage and store data in their applications. It can be particularly useful for mobile app developers who need to store small to medium-sized data in a fast and efficient manner.</p><h2 id="what-get-storage-is" tabindex="-1">What Get Storage is <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-get-storage-is" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Persistent key/value storage for Android, iOS, Web, Linux, Mac and Fuchsia and Windows, that combines fast memory access with persistent storage.</p><h2 id="what-get-storage-is-not" tabindex="-1">What Get Storage is NOT <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-get-storage-is-not" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>A database.
